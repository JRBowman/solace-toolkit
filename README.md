The _Solace Toolkit (TK) for Game Development_ offers a **Data-Oriented Framework** to build and design games in your engine of choice.

# Data-Oriented Framework
This Toolkit uses a Data-Oriented Framework self-titled _Soldof_ (Solace Data-Oriented Framework) - It is comprised of a series of **Interfaces and Data Contracts** which define **Data Models** that encompass the general needs of the game system: 
> **Actor Controllers** that have **Behavior Systems** which define **Branches** that select **States** by **Conditions** - providing **Animation**, **Action/Movement**, and **State Management**.

Each of these components of the game system are captured as **Serialized Data Models** - The **Models** collectively define Objects and Behaviors that can be applied and implemented against Objects in the Game Engine of Choice, using the **Data Contracts and Interfaces** Defined by the **Models**
